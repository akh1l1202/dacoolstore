It sounds like you have a clear plan for the user flow and functionalities of your application. This is a solid foundation to begin building your online merchandise store. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how you might approach implementing these features:

1. *GUI Development:*

   - Ask the user if they are a staff or customer
   - If customer, create a main window with login functionality for customer.
   - If staff, ask them for their password, if password matches with password of any staff show their name and say welcome and open a window to show all the existing customer orders
   - 
   - 

2. *Customer Functionality:*

   - After customer login, show options to "See My Orders" and "Make an Order."
   - Implement logic to display existing orders and allow customers to view their order details from the `OrderItems` table.
   - Implement logic to allow customers to browse categories, select products, and place new orders.
   - Display order summary after placing an order and ask if they want to create another order.

3. *Staff Functionality:*

   - Implement staff login functionality and display staff-specific options.
   - Provide access to customer information and order details for staff.
   - Allow staff to add new categories and products, which will involve inserting data into the `Categories` and `Products` tables.

4. *Database Interaction:*

   - Implement functions to interact with the database, including retrieving customer information, orders, products, and categories, as well as inserting new data.

5. *User Authentication:*

   - Implement secure user authentication for both customers and staff.
   - Hash and store passwords securely in the database.

6. *Category and Product Display:*

   - Retrieve categories and products from the database and display them on the GUI.
   - Allow customers to select products and add them to their orders.

7. *Order Processing:*

   - Implement the logic for customers to place orders, including inserting order information into the `Orders` and `OrderItems` tables.

8. *GUI Navigation:*

   - Implement buttons and navigation to transition between different screens and functionalities based on user choices.

9. *Error Handling and Validation:*

   - Implement validation to ensure correct inputs and handle potential errors.

10. *Testing:*

    - Thoroughly test your application to ensure all features work as intended.

11. *Deployment and Iteration:*

    - Deploy your application and gather user feedback.
    - Iterate and improve based on feedback, adding new features and refining existing ones.

Remember that building an application involves both frontend and backend development. You'll need to implement GUI elements, handle user interactions, and manage the flow of data between the frontend and backend. Additionally, consider implementing security measures, optimizing database queries, and adhering to best practices for maintainable code.
